# pyDeminer

## What is it?
pyDeminer is a [python3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/ "python3")
version of the famous game called "Deminer" based on the
[pygame library](https://www.pygame.org/news "pygame library").
## What's the purpose?
I made it to learn some things about python and pygame.
It's **not** intended to be perfect!
Some things such as architecture, coding styles... might not be "good" or "professionnal".
So feel free to comment, open issues or contribute to make it better!
(The current UI is not really pretty :) ).
